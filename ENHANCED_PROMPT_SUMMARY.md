# Enhanced Prompt Structure for Content Generation

This document summarizes the enhancements made to the prompt structure for generating content that even more closely matches the GA lesson and lab examples.

## Key Enhancements

Building on our previous improvements, we've made the following enhancements to the prompt structure:

1. **Added Step-by-Step Guidance**
   - Instructions to build functionality incrementally
   - Requirements for showing immediate results after each step
   - Guidance to provide code snippets at each step, not just at the end
   - Prompts to include "Try it out" moments after each significant change

2. **Enhanced Practical Elements**
   - Requirement to include at least 5 hands-on activities
   - Instruction that each concept should be immediately followed by application
   - Guidance to frame the lesson within a realistic development scenario
   - Requirement to include references to industry practices

3. **Improved Instructional Design**
   - Added timing estimates for each section
   - Included "Why This Matters" sections connecting concepts to job skills
   - Added instructor notes about potential confusion points
   - Included checkpoint moments where students can verify their progress

4. **Enhanced Interactive Elements**
   - Added specific questions for students to consider at key points
   - Included expandable sections with `<details>` tags for labs
   - Added "Challenge" sections for students who want to go deeper
   - Included user stories that define functionality from the user's perspective

## Results

The enhanced prompt structure has resulted in generated content that much more closely matches the example lessons and labs:

1. **Lesson Format Enhancements**
   - Timing estimates for each section (e.g., "Introduction (10 mins)")
   - "Try it out" sections after each major concept
   - "Why This Matters" sections connecting concepts to job skills
   - More practical, hands-on activities

2. **Lab Format Enhancements**
   - Clear day-by-day breakdowns
   - User stories that define functionality from the user's perspective
   - Checkpoint moments where students can verify their progress
   - "Challenge" sections for students who want to go deeper

## Implementation

We've created two new scripts that implement the enhanced prompt structure:

1. **enhanced_claude_generator.py**
   - A comprehensive script that integrates with your metadata
   - Includes enhanced format instructions, content standards, and step-by-step guidance
   - Uses more detailed examples from your existing content
   - Generates prompts that produce content more closely aligned with your examples

2. **test_enhanced_prompt.py**
   - A simplified script for testing the enhanced prompt structure
   - Includes all the enhancements in a more streamlined format
   - Makes it easy to test different topics and file types

## How to Use

### Using the Enhanced Claude Generator

1. Run the script:
   ```
   python3 enhanced_claude_generator.py
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to select a category and item to generate content for.

3. Review the generated prompt and confirm that you want to proceed.

4. The script will send the prompt to Claude and save the generated content to the `generated_content` directory.

### Using the Test Enhanced Prompt Script

1. Edit the script to specify the topic and file type:
   ```python
   # Test parameters
   topic = "Your Topic"
   file_type = "lesson"  # or "lab"
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```
   python3 test_enhanced_prompt.py
   ```

3. The script will generate a prompt, send it to Claude, and save the generated content to the `generated_content` directory.

## Enhanced Prompt Structure

The enhanced prompt structure consists of the following components:

```
{basic_prompt}

{metrics_prompt}

{format_instructions}

{standards_prompt}

{step_by_step_prompt}

{example_prompt}

Please generate complete, well-structured content that follows all the guidelines above.
```

Where:
- `basic_prompt` includes the topic and learning objectives
- `metrics_prompt` specifies content metrics like word count and text-to-code ratio
- `format_instructions` provides specific formatting guidelines based on the file type
- `standards_prompt` outlines the enhanced content standards
- `step_by_step_prompt` provides detailed guidance on building functionality incrementally
- `example_prompt` includes an example of the desired format

## Example Generated Content

You can find examples of content generated using the enhanced prompt structure in the `generated_content` directory:

- `test_enhanced_lesson_React_Hooks.md`: A lesson on React Hooks

This example demonstrates how the enhanced prompt structure generates content that closely matches your example lessons and labs, with improved practical elements, step-by-step guidance, and instructional design.

## Comparison with Previous Versions

The enhanced prompt structure builds on our previous improvements and adds more specific guidance on:

1. **Building Functionality Incrementally**
   - Previous: General instruction to follow 30% theory, 70% hands-on practice ratio
   - Enhanced: Specific guidance to build functionality incrementally, show immediate results after each step, and provide code snippets at each step

2. **Practical Application**
   - Previous: General instruction to include practical examples and demonstrations
   - Enhanced: Specific requirement to include at least 5 hands-on activities and ensure each concept is immediately followed by application

3. **Instructional Design**
   - Previous: General instruction to write for instructor live delivery over Zoom
   - Enhanced: Specific guidance to include timing estimates for each section, instructor notes about potential confusion points, and "Why This Matters" sections

4. **Interactive Elements**
   - Previous: General instruction to ensure content is engaging and interactive
   - Enhanced: Specific guidance to include specific questions for students to consider at key points, "Try it out" moments after each significant change, and checkpoint moments where students can verify their progress

## Next Steps

1. **Fine-tune the Enhanced Prompt Structure**: Continue to refine the prompt structure based on the results.
2. **Expand the Example Library**: Add more examples of different content types.
3. **Integrate with CrewAI**: As mentioned in your project goals, integrate this with CrewAI Agents.
4. **Implement Quality Control**: Add a review process for generated content.
