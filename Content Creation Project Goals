Content Generation Automation Project Goals

We build content for a coding bootcamp. We primarily build our content in github repos and organize multiple lesson repos into an organization to make an entire course. 

We have a large repository of content organized into .md files for our lesson documents, as well as start and soltuion code for our labs. 

Our goal is to create a workflow that can leverage our existing content to guide a LLM to generate new lesson and lab content and ultimtaely an entire course. 

We will eventually build this workflow using CrewAI Agents. But for this project, we want to just focus on getting a LLM to build new content that meets our standards. 

Our standards are: 

- All lesson markdown follow our consistent brand guidelines 
- All lesson markdown follow our learning design patterns 
- All lessons follow a logical sequenece where one lesson leads into the next. The same is true with labs. 
- Each lesson is one repo 
- A course is made up of many repos in an org 
- We are a project based learning organization, our lessons are 30 percent theory, with 70 percent applied hands on practice and demonstrations, that prepare a learning to then do more indepdenent practice of those skills in a lab. 
- Our lessons are in American English 
- Our lessons include diagrams and visuals to illustrate points 
- Our lessons are typically 60 minutes to 90 minutes 
- Our lessons always begin with clear learning objectives 
- Our lessons are written for instructor live delivery, our deliveries are often do over zoom, with the instructor sharing their screen and walking through a .md and talking through the lessons materials, demonstrating code or other activities in their IDE or other tech tool as appropriate with students coding along.
