Unit testing is a crucial aspect of software development that helps ensure the correctness and reliability of your code. In Python, the `unittest` framework provides a robust and flexible way to write and run unit tests. This lesson aims to introduce you to the fundamentals of unit testing in Python using the `unittest` module.

Learning Objectives:
- Understand the basics of unit testing in Python
- Learn how to use the `unittest` framework
- Practice writing test cases for functions

We'll start with a brief overview of unit testing concepts and why it's important. Then, we'll dive into the `unittest` module, exploring its basic structure and how to create test cases.

The majority of our time will be dedicated to hands-on practice, where you'll write test cases for various Python functions. You'll learn how to assert expected outcomes, handle edge cases, and organize your tests effectively.

Throughout the lesson, we'll work on a project-based exercise, allowing you to apply your newfound knowledge in a practical setting. This approach will reinforce your understanding and provide you with valuable experience in writing robust unit tests.

By the end of this lesson, you'll have a solid grasp of unit testing in Python and the ability to write effective test cases, ensuring the quality and maintainability of your code.
