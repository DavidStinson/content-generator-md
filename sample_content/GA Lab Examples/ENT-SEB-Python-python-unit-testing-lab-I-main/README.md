## Part 1

- Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained in the string `s`. Valid vowels are: `'a', 'e', 'i', 'o',
  and 'u'`. For example, if `s = 'azcbobobegghakl'`, your program should print: `Number of vowels: 5`.

- Write a program that prints the number of times the string `bob` occurs in `s`. For example,
  if `s = 'azcbobobegghakl'`, then your program should print `Number of times bob occurs is: 2`.

- Ask the user to input a string and then reversal the given input. `Input: "Programming in Python"`, `Output: nohtyP ni
  gnimmargorP`.

- Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of uppercase letters and lowercase letters. Suppose
  the
  following input is supplied to the program. `Input: Hello World`, `Output: UPPERCASE: 2, LOWERCASE: 9`. You may count
  space as lowercase.

- Write a program that accepts a comma-separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated
  sequence after sorting them alphabetically. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: `without, hello,
  bag, world` Then, the output should be: `bag, hello, without, world`.

- Ask the user to enter a string, and check if it is a palindrome. If yes, print `True`, or else print `False`.

## Part 2

Using the solutions from Part 1, write unit tests for each of the six programs to verify that they work correctly.

## How to submit homework

### Setup

- Step 1. Fork the repository
- Step 2. Clone your fork

### Submitting work

- Step 1. Complete your work in `test\unit` directory, you should have six test classes in total
- Step 2. Push to your fork
- Step 3. Submit a pull request
- Step 3.1. Add a title (First name, Last Name) and comment

In the comment section, you must add the following:

```text
* Comfort level [0 to 5]
